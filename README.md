## My process

1. Prepare the grid layer for the cards based on a browsesr width first
2. Based on the intended layout to assign cards to occupy which of the grid area
3. Set-up basic CSS styles (i.e: background-color, border) for each card
4. Turn the Profile Div into a sub-grid, so as to place the Profile pic on the Left and the User Name + Title on the Right
5. Moving on to lower down the width size and see any re-position of the cards to make a decent look and feel for user at a Tablet Browser width
6. Adjust and re-position of the layout to support Mobile Phone Browser Width
7. Fine tune to adjust the Text Color
